# Lambda VUI

This component library is designed for use with Vue 3 and is built using the Composition API. It features a modern, flat design with the NORD color palette and includes both light and dark themes.

The library also includes a customizable toast plugin, which enables you to display success, error, info, and warning messages in various positions and durations. Additionally, the library features customizable color animations that activate when users interact with components like inputs.

It's intended to be used with [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel), [InertiaJS](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia) and [Vue 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue).

There is currently no documentation for this library, but it will be added in the future.
